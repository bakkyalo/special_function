You can download the entire PDF document [here](https://github.com/bakkyalo/special_function/blob/main/main/main.pdf).

If you want to see how it works, please typeset _main/main.tex_ with pdfpLaTeX.
~~Although it may no be pdfpLaTeX.~~

There may be a lot of required style-files, but I have not been able to figure out all of them.
If you get an error that it is missing, please introduce it each time. (sorry)

The figures in this document are drawn using TikZ or Python.

The TikZ source can be found under [the TikZ directory](https://github.com/bakkyalo/special_function/tree/main/TikZ), and the Python source code is available at [this repository](https://github.com/bakkyalo/python_simulation_backup/tree/main/special-function).
